# Metaverse

## A Framework for testing Cognitive Agents in a variety of virtual environments

The Metaverse repository is dedicated to the development of a framework to support the empirical evaluation of intelligent cognitive agents that are based on the Common Model of Cognition. The framework is divided into two interrelated sub-systems; the MetaMind, and the Multiverse. 

**MetaMind** is an abstract interface for common cognitive architectures that conform to most or all of the Common Model. Supported architectures currently include ACT-R, SOAR, and Sigma. 

**Multiverse** is an abstract interface for a multitude of virtual environments that support the training and testing of intelligent agents. Supported environments include OpenAI Gym, and Starcraft 2.

These two subsystems are tied together by a common graphical interface to run experiments with various combinations of architectures and environments, and to measure the interface points within each agent, and the overall effects on external performance.

Installation: Installation is the next section in an effective README. Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.

Usage: The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

Contributing: Larger projects often have sections on contributing to their project, in which contribution instructions are outlined. Sometimes, this is a separate file. If you have specific contribution preferences, explain them so that other developers know how to best contribute to your work. To learn more about how to help others contribute, check out the guide for setting guidelines for repository contributors.

Credits: Include a section for credits in order to highlight and link to the authors of your project.

License: Finally, include a section for the license of your project. For more information on choosing a license, check out GitHub’s licensing guide!
