## A Framework for testing Cognitive Agents in a variety of virtual environments

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/CyberChad/Metaverse/wiki) for more information.

The Metaverse repository is dedicated to the development of a framework to support the empirical evaluation of intelligent cognitive agents that are based on the Common Model of Cognition. The framework is divided into two interrelated sub-systems; the MetaMind, and the Multiverse. 

**MetaMind** is an abstract interface for common cognitive architectures that conform to most or all of the Common Model. Supported architectures currently include ACT-R, SOAR, and Sigma. 

**Multiverse** is an abstract interface for a multitude of virtual environments that support the training and testing of intelligent agents. Supported environments include OpenAI Gym, and Starcraft 2.

These two subsystems are tied together by a common graphical interface to run experiments with various combinations of architectures and environments, and to measure the interface points within each agent, and the overall effects on external performance.
