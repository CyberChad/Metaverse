# Memory - from Laird et al 37t Soar Workshop

# Declarative and procedural LTMs contain symbol* structures and associated quantitative metadata
# Global communication is provided by a short-term WM
# Global control is provided by procedural LTM
# Composed of rule-like conditions and actions
# Exerts control by altering contents of WM
# Factual knowledge is provided by declarative LTM

#Learning  - from Laird et al 37t Soar Workshop
# All forms of LTM content are learnable
# Learning occurs online and incrementally, as a side effect of performance and is often based on an inversion of the flow of information from performance
# Procedural learning involves at least reinforcement learning and procedural composition
# Reinforcement learning yields weights over action selection
# Procedural composition yields behavioral automatization
# Declarative learning involves the acquisition of facts and tuning of their metadata
# More complex forms of learning involve combinations of the fixed set of simpler forms of learning
