### Blocks world that uses the selection problem space (from the default folder) to do 
### do operator subgoaling with means-ends analysis
### In this approach, operators are proposed if they reduce the difference between the current state
###  and the desired state, even if they cannot be applied in the current state.
### If they can be applied, then forward progress occurs.
### If they cannot be applied, an operator subgoal arises and in the subgoal, the agent
###  tries to select operators that moves the agent to a state where the selected operator can apply.
