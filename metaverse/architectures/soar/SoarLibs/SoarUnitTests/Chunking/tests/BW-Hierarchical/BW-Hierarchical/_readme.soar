# This project contains a version of blocks world that involves three levels of problem spaces.
# There is sufficient evaluation knowledge so that there is no search/uncertainty at every level.
#  
# The top level has a single operator: move-block, which moves a block (moving-block) to a destination. 
# The destination can be the top of another block or the table.

# The next level consists of two operators: pick-up and put-down and they arise in an operator
#  no-change for move-block. The rules for these are found under move-block. This level
#  introduces the gripper, which can be holding a block or empty and is a structure on the top state.

# The bottom level has a variety of operators: open-gripper, close-gripper, move-gripper-above, 
#  move-gripper-down, and move-gripper-up. The structures manipulated by these operators are part
#  of the gripper structure on the top state. These operators arise in an operator no-change for
#  both pick-up and put-down and the rules for them are under pick-up. 

## Includes gripper status to state.
## Execution is done through top-state rules that simulate changes to the io-link
##
# Works with chunking, which compiles the actions in the substates into rules that apply 
#  at the top-state.  Use the command "learn -e" to turn on chunking, run the agent once, init-soar
#  then run the agent again to see how the learned productions eliminate the need to subgoal in the 
#  second run.
