# Processing yields bounded rationality, not optimality
# Processing based on a few task-independent modules
# There is significant parallelism in architectural processing
# Processing is parallel across modules
# Processing is parallel within modules
# A cognitive cycle that runs at ~50 ms per cycle in humans drives behavior via sequential action selection
# Complex behavior arises from a sequence of independent cognitive cycles that operate in their local context
